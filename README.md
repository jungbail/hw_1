## LLM Use Disclosure 

It has now become common practice to disclose the use of AI / LLMs in work, such as research papers and projects. When disclosing your use of LLMs in this assignment, provide the following: (1) Which AI tool you used and for what specific purpose, (2) The actual prompts you entered (if any). Including your prompts demonstrates transparency and helps others understand your approach, (3) What you kept, modified, or rejected from the AI's responses, and (4) How the AI assistance influenced your final work. Be specific and honest in your disclosure.  Note, if using copilot or other LLM for autocomplete, you don't have to disclose all auto complete, but you should disclose how it was evaluated in addition to what extent it was used.
